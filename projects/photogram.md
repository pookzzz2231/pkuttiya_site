#### Introduction
My employee has a chance to demonstrate a Ruby on Rails's potentials as per our client's request regarding a prototype sample application emphasizing on social network photo sharing, hence Photogram was designed.  

Although the application still has a lot of room to contribute, it has most of the modern social network requirements, and could also demonstrate the efficiency of Ruby on Rails.

#### Research and ideas
Most of modern social network applications share some of the common components, such as followings, likes, upload photos and comments. The building process for photogram would break into backend part which interact between users request and server response, and front-end part, which mostly interacts with Jquery and Ajax. For further implementation, React or other front-end framework could come into use, if preferred.

As stated above, photogram was decided to be built with Rails TDD principle for the back-end, implemented by Jquery/Ajax on the front-end, with future expectation on implementing some React on Rails. Below is the tests that are used for the app.

{: .table .table-responsive .table-bordered}  
{% include project/test.md %}

Additionally, the app also focusing on mobile and resposive design.

#### Features for non-registered users
Visitors will be forced to land on login/register page.

> Registration authentication is implemented without Devise.

!register page photo

Live search for users(manually implemented without gem)

!live search photo

Visit each user profile page at `/user_name`, view profile information,
posts count, followers/followings count and uploaded photo in thumbnails format.

!user profile photo

Visit and view user's photo post.

> Each post permalink is encrypted and randomly generated by unique token.

!user post photo

#### Features for registered users
After user registration; with unique username, user will be redirected to the user profile page, with the default avatar photo.

!profile page default photo

User can update avatar and include information such as name, website, bio and email address.

> All uploaded photos are stored remotely with Amazon S3 services.

!profile edit photo

Ability to create new post, by navigate to add photo shortcut.  

!highlight header add photo photo

Create post with image, location and caption.

!new post photo

User can create hashtags with `#` following by letters or numbers in caption field, 
the app will find existings tags in the database and group posts with the same hashtags at `/tags/hashtag_name`.

> Hashtag will be newly created if not yet existed in the database.

!hashtags page photo

User can comment, like or unlike on any user's post(including own posts), as well as hashtag on comment. 
Additionally, user can also mention other user on comment by prepend other username with `@`. 

> Hashtags and mentions are handled by implementing rails view logic, which will create a link inside comment for `#hashtag_name`, `@user_name` to `/tags/hashtag_name` and `/user_name`.

> Photogram limited user to be able to like only one time per post(create `like` in DB for the new `like`). 
If liked on the same post again, like will be updated(update `like` DB to false), then render view accordingly.  

Noted that `like` will not be destroyed but updated its value instead, preventing DB from unnecessarily creating and destroying `Like table` in DB for repeatedly like from the same user. 

!post comment photo

User can follow other users dynamically via other user profile page, or by visiting own/others followers, followings link on the profile page. 

Followers and Followings link in user profile page will show a popup modal when vistied; implemented with Rails Ajax to get view from another template, which user can follow or unfollow user within a popup modal.

> Follow and unfollow will update Rails relation DB as well as render view accordingly.

!follow user profile photo  
!follow user modal photo

Notification for users when user's post gets commented or liked, user gets mentioned or followed. 
Also, will notified user when user's `following user` posted a new post.  

Additionally, displaying new notifications count when user login back to account. Notification will resets to zero after user visits notification button, then restart the count for new notification if received as stated per event above.

> Notification also handles some edge cases. For example, if `user_1` comments or mentions on `user_2` at the same post multiple times, will only considered comment/mention notification to count as one. 

!notification photo

{: .alert .alert-grey}
For a better user's experience; comment, like, and follow functionality are implemented with Rails Unobtrusive JavaScript. Along with updating its value without reloading page via Rails's Ajax process.
